Monthly Momentum Sessions

The Zeitgeist Movement is a global sustainability organisation based on using the best in science, technology and innovation to make a more positive world for future generations. Monthly Momentum Sessions are fun, free and inclusive public townhall events designed to make learning about global sustainability exciting and interesting. We show movies, short clips, participate in discussions, collaborate on creating more events together including jam sessions, projects, camping trips at communities and more.
